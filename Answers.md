1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack** LIFO
   - **Queue** FIFO
2. What is the retrieval time complexity for the following data structures?
   - **Linked List** O(n) access & search, O(1) insertion & deletion
   - **Hash Table** O (1)
   - **Binary Search Trees** O(log(n))
2. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?  
For efficient search/retrieval, insertion, and/or removals.
In an array, the more items, the longer it takes to find them.
Hash table can go exactly to the place to retrieve the value because it returns the same index for same key
